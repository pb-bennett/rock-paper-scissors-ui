A new version of Rock Paper Scissors, this time with a UI

After many hours of experimenting I have created a working Rock Paper Scissors game. In the process I discovered Inkscape which I have used extensively in this project to manipulate and create vector images. I have probably used far too many images and as a result have zero normal text in the final project. This is probably not ideal but I have had fun learning how I can make things work :)

I have also tried my best to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) although there are probably still places where I could use functions to cut down on the code. I have also overcomplicated the game in a lot of places, but again I have had fun and have learned LOTS - which was the aim!

Credit for the original Rock Paper Scissors vector image goes to:

Many thanks!

After I discovered Inkscape I butched the original image - I hope this does not cause offence!

The font used in the vector images is "Neon Nanoborg" by Darrel Flood. Many thanks for this also!
